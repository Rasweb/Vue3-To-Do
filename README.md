# to-do-list

Welcome to my Zelda inspired to do list. Created using vueJs with Sass/sass, typeScript and single file component through vueJs.

This project was created because I wanted to learn more about VueJs a JavaScript framework. This is also my first vuejs project, which means that almost everything in this project was unkown to me in the beginning.

Every text information are from "The Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild" Nintendo game on Nintendo Switch.
