## Overview

### To Do project

Welcome to my Zelda inspired to do list. Built using vueJs with Scss/sass, typeScript and single file component via vueJs.

This project was created in order to know more about VueJs a JavaScript framework. It is also my first vuejs project, which means that nearly everything about this project was unknown to me at first.

Almost all textual information comes from Nintendo's "The Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild" game.
